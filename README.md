# sorting-times
Testing several sorting algorithms by sorting several Shakespeare plays of varying lengths.

<ins>Purpose</ins>

The purpose of this lab is to compare the various sorting algorithms that we have learned so far. We would first read in the shakespeare .txt files and then sort them according to the guidelines. The program is user friendly and should provide a variety of different options

To read the files in, I first declared a variable called infile of type std::ifstream. I then included an if else statement to stream in a file based on the userâ€™s preference. Each branch of the if-else statement streams in and stores each .txt input as a std::string variable declared as text. There is also an if statement to check if the file was successfully streamed in. To store the streamed in text, I decided to create a structure called Multstring. In this structure, I have two std::string variables. One of them, punc, will be used to store the initial text streamed in unedited. The second std::string, nopunc, will take in the same text that was streamed in after it has been modified to remove punctuation to make sorting easier. To store all of the std::string words, I declared a vector of the user defined type Multstring. 

To fill the vector, I decided to use a while loop with the condition !infile.eof() which will execute the code inside the while loop until all the text is streamed in. The initial text is placed in the punc member of the Multstring object called play which was declared at the top of the main() function. 

To filter out the punctuations, I decided to use a while loop and the ispunct() function to scan the string for any sort of punctuation. The new formatted std::string was then placed in the nopunc member of the struct variable. After the Multstring variables were initialized I made my Multstring vector play increase in size using the push_back() function. At the end of the while loop, I made sure to increment an int variable named count which will be used as a parameter for my future functions and as a debugging variable.

After the Multstring vector is fully initialized, we progress to the next user prompt below:
